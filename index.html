          <p class="lead">Thankyou for viewing my online <strong>portfolio page!</strong> I am one week into a <em>software engineering bootcamp</em> here in downtown Portland and I am amazed at the things we have learned. We all came to epicodus so that we can learn to build things, and here is my website!!!! Please explore and find out more about my story!</p>

          <h3 class="infotitle">Steak</h3>
          <p>Steak is the best food on earth, not just good for you, but also the best tasting thing that can enter your mouth hole.  I eat steak to make sure I get the necessary protein to sustain my body for the day.  I cook 3, 4, sometimes 5 pounds of steam a day to  make sure I get my red meat calorie intake for the day, this helps me be a better programmer and person</p>

          <h3 class="infotitle">World travel</h3>
          <p>I have been to 15 countries, lived in 3 different states, and 3 differnet countries.  I have stood at 14,000ft peaks, and I have been 100ft underwater, I have seen amazon rainforest and dry granite rockbeds, I am a diverse person and believe I will bring all these experiences and excitement to programming.</p>

          <p>As Mark Cuban would say I am a wantrepeneur, I like the idea of being an entrepeneur I just havent done it yet, I really would love to build a company and sell it.</p>
